# Walmart Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates my expertise in large-scale data analysis and business intelligence by analyzing Walmart's sales data to provide key insights. Through the use of SQL, Python, and Power BI, I developed a comprehensive sales analysis framework that identifies trends, forecasts future sales, and delivers actionable business insights. 

This project showcases my ability to work with real-world datasets, deliver impactful results, and communicate insights effectively through visualizations and reports.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Designed and executed complex queries to extract relevant insights from Walmart’s sales data.
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)**: Conducted data wrangling, manipulation, and statistical analysis for efficient data exploration.
- **Power BI**: Created an interactive and user-friendly dashboard to visualize sales trends and provide stakeholders with actionable insights.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Employed for creating in-depth visualizations to support data-driven decisions.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Documented and demonstrated the analysis process, including exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model-building (optional).

## Key Contributions
- **Strategic Insights**: Extracted key trends from Walmart’s sales data that inform pricing strategies, promotional decisions, and inventory management.
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Created a dynamic Power BI dashboard allowing stakeholders to explore sales performance at a glance.
- **Data-Driven Forecasting**: Utilized regression analysis to predict future sales trends, supporting strategic business planning.
